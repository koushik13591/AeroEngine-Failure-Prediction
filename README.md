# AeroEngine-Failure-Prediction

This project aims to enhance aviation safety by predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the air-craft jet engines and provide support formaintenance and for operation planing. The dataset for this project is taken from NASAâ€™s open data portal. This dataset contain CMAPSS Jet Engine simulated data. CMAPSS stands for Commercial Modular Aero Propulsion System Simulation.
